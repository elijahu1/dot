# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I primarily use **Arch Linux**, but from time to time, Iâ€™ve been known to use **Arco**, **Manjaro**, or another Arch-based distro. **Solus** is also dope, although it doesn't need much configuration. I also run **Debian** or **Ubuntu** on a few server systems, so I ensure my dotfiles work there as well. And, on the rare occasion, I use a **MacBook**, where most of these dotfiles also work without issue.

## Main Things Here

## My Setup

Currently, my primary system is **Arch Linux** running on a **Ryzen 5 2600X (6-core)** CPU with a **GTX 1050Ti**. I use the **Awesome Window Manager** as my window manager (yes, it's paired with Polybar because I like it that way â€” don't judge). Though I do enjoy **DWM** and **BSPWM**, **Awesome** has my heart. For transparency effects, I use **iBhagwan's Picom Fork**.

My terminal of choice is **Alacritty** (with **kitty** or **st** as a backup), and **Neovim** is my go-to text editor. 

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

- **Window Manager**: Awesome WM (with Polybar)
- **Terminal**: Alacritty (kitty or st as backup)
- **Editor**: Neovim
- **Compositor**: iBhagwan's Picom Fork
- **System**: Arch Linux (on Ryzen 5 2600X, GTX 1050Ti)
